# Ortelius Website

The website is based on the [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) web server + the [docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme.

Hugo uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in conjunction with the themes to drive the formatting of the page content as html.  Git is used to persist the markdown and themes and provides updating the web site via a Pull Request.  The [Ortelius Website Repo](https://github.com/ortelius/website) is where the production site is created from.  Please fork the repo and use Pull Requests to get your changes merged back into the production site. See [Contributing](https://docs.ortelius.io/guides/contributorguide/) to Ortelius Project for details.

## Merging your changes

Create a PR in the [ortelius/website](https://github.com/ortelius/website) repo referencing
your forked repo as where to merge from.  

Make sure that you squash your commits in your local repo before doing your push.  See the [Git PR Cheatsheet](https://docs.ortelius.io/guides/contributorguide/pull-request-cheat-sheet/) for instructions.  Also, reference any issues for example as `resolves ortelius/ortelius#201` so they will close on the completion of the merge.

After your changes have been merge the Cloudbuild job will trigger and push your chnages to the Kubernetes cluster and the [production site](https://ortelius.io).
